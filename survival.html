    <h2>How I Survived My Mechanical Engineering Degree (The Brutal Truth)</h2>

    <p>If you’re reading this, you’re probably drowning in assignments, battling terrible group members, or wondering why your lecturer speaks in an alien language. I get it—I’ve been there.</p>

    <p>Surviving a Mechanical Engineering degree isn’t just about being smart. It’s about strategy, resilience, and knowing when to take matters into your own hands. Here’s how I made it through (without losing my sanity).</p>

    <h3>1. Survival Skill is the Key</h3>
    <p>Let’s be real: Engineering is a warzone. You don’t just need intelligence—you need tactics.</p>

    <h4>The Group Assignment Nightmare</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Assume your group will slack. Hope for the best, but prepare to do 90% of the work.</li>
      <li>Take charge early. Set deadlines before the actual deadline.</li>
      <li>If they don’t contribute, cut your losses and do it yourself.</li>
      <li>Document everything. If freeloaders try to take credit, receipts save your GPA.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Time Management = Survival</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You can’t cram engineering. Break tasks into daily chunks.</li>
      <li>Learn to say no. Social FOMO is real, but failing exams is worse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Lecturer Terrible? YouTube is Your Savior</h3>
    <p>Not all lecturers are bad—some are godsends. But if yours is incomprehensible:</p>

    <h4>If Your Lecturer is Good:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Attend every class. Soak up their wisdom like a sponge.</li>
      <li>Ask questions. They’re your best resource.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>If Your Lecturer is Useless:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Still go to class (but don’t stress). Use lecture time to work on practice problems instead of zoning out.</li>
      <li>YouTube is your real lecturer. Try:</li>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Jeff Hanson</strong> – Mechanics</li>
        <li><strong>The Efficient Engineer</strong> – Concepts</li>
        <li><strong>Michel van Biezen</strong> – Problem-solving</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Textbooks &gt; Slides. A good book can save hours of confusion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Assignments Will Try to Kill You (Here’s How to Fight Back)</h3>
    <p>Assignments aren’t just busywork—they’re exam prep in disguise.</p>

    <h4>Why 100% Commitment Matters:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>They’re usually 30–50% of your grade. Half-effort = guaranteed regret.</li>
      <li>Exam questions often come from assignments. Skip them and you’re doomed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>How to Actually Handle Assignments:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>✔ Start early. (Procrastination = all-nighters = pain.)</li>
      <li>✔ Do every problem—even the “optional” ones.</li>
      <li>✔ Stuck? Ask for help. Try friends, TAs, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents" target="_blank">Reddit</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Final Advice: It’s a Marathon, Not a Sprint</h3>
    <p>You’ll have days where you question your life choices. That’s normal. But remember:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Consistency beats last-minute panic.</li>
      <li>Self-study &gt; relying on bad lecturers.</li>
      <li>Your degree is hard, but so are you.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>If I survived, so can you. Now go crush those assignments.</strong></p>
